///
/// Conclusion: Should you use this?
///     - This adds very light "reactive style" convenience interface on top of kvo.
///     - It's available in objc which I like writing more.
///     - It's usually slightly faster than combine but in the same ballpark.  For performance critical things, you'd still want to use simple function calls and for UI stuff the performance difference doesn't matter.
///     - I wrote it and control it so I might understand how to use it better.
///         - Actually, when using Combine as a wrapper for kvo, using `someObject.publisher(for:<keyPath>)`, then Combine is around 4x slower in our tests, but for UI Stuff this still probably doesn't matter.
///     - I have a general dislike for Swift and all this weird fancy abstractions that don't add much and make the language feel inelegant imo. (`CompactMapping a subscription` in combine is the same as using `if (newValue == nil) return;` in our interface.) But this doesn't really matter for the quality of the app, it's just my personal preference.
///     - The build times for MMF 3 are really annoyingly slow. And I suspect that swift is a big factor in that. Since I also sort of dislike writing Swift, I might want to move away from Swift and write more of the UI Stuff in objc. And this might enable that. Some of the main reasons we use so much swift is that we wanted to use reactive patterns for the UI of MMF, which lead us to include the ReactiveSwift framework and build much of the UI code in Swift.
///     - BIG CON: This needs to be thread safe. I tried but thread safety is hard. If there are subtle bugs in this, we might make the app less stable vs using an established framework or API.
///     -> Overall this was a cool experiment. It was fund and I learned a bunch of things. Maybe we can adopt this into MMF at some point, but we should probably only adopt it for a new major release where we can thoroughly test this before rolling it out to non-beta users.
///
///     Other takeaways:
///     - Due to the Benchmarks we made for this I saw that, for simple arithmetic and function calling, pure swift seems to be around 4 - 6x faster than our pure C code!! That's incredible and very unexpected.
///         Unfortunately, when you use frameworks or higher level datatypes with Swift, and interoperate with objc, that can sometimes slow things down a lot in unpredictable ways. (See the whole `SWIFT_UNBRIDGED` hassle in MMF.) Objc/C and its frameworks seem more predictable and consistent to me. But for really low level routines or if you use it right, swift can actually be incredibly fast, which is cool and good to know, and makes me like the language a bit more.
///
///
/// Main discussion
///     I think we can replace any need for reactive frameworks in our app with a very simple custom API providing a thin wrapper around Apple's Key-Value-Observation.
///
///     Design considerations:
///
///     We want to create a very simple API consisting of 4 methods:
///
///        Simple observation:
///             ```
///             BlockObserver *buttonObserver = [button observe@"value" withBlock:^(NSString *newValue) {
///                 otherValue = [newValue stringByAppendingString:@"Hello from KVO block!"]
///                 self.something = value;
///             }];
///             ```
///
///        Cancel observation:
///             ```
///             [buttonObserver cancelObservation];
///             ```
///
///        Observe latest:
///             ```
///             NSArray *observers = [BlockObserver observeLatest2:@[@[button, @"value"], @[slider, @"doubleValue"]] withBlock ^(int updatedValueIndex, NSValue *v1, NSValue *v2) {
///                 int buttonValue = unboxNSValue(int, v1);
///                 double sliderValue = unboxNSValue(int, v2);
///                 ...
///             }];
///             ```
///
///         Cancel observeLatest:
///             ```
///             [BlockObserver cancelObservations:observers];
///             ```
///
/// Comparison with Reactive frameworks:
///     - Key-value-observation should be extremely fast, since it's quite old and mature and at the core of many of Apple's libraries.
///         It should be much faster than ReactiveSwift, and perhaps even faster than Combine. Update: Combine also seems to use KVO under the hood at least when observing properties @objc objects, but it adds a lot of overhead
///     - Most reactive features like backpressure, errors, hot & cold signals etc, are totally unnecessary for us.
///     - Any 'maps' or 'filters' or similar transforms on 'streams of values over time' we can simply do inside our observation callback block.
///         E.g. filter is just an `if (xyz) return;` statement. compactMap is just `if (newValue == nil) return;`
///     - We can do scheduling by just calling functions like `dispatch_async()` inside the callback block.
///     - As far as I can think of, the only useful thing for MMF  in Reactive frameworks that goes beyond this basic API would be debouncing,
///             but even that we could replace by adding an NSTimer and 3 lines of code inside an observation callback block.
///     - Basically all property or other values assigned to any NSObject (even NSDictionary) should be observable with KVO - and by extension our BlockObserver API.
///         (KVO works on any setters that use the `setValue:` naming scheming afaik)
///
///     -> Overall this should provide a very performant, simple and modular interface for doing everything we want to do with a Reactive framework.
///

///
/// Performance:
///     Just ran benchmarks on kvo wrapper and this is 3.5x - 5.0x (Update: 4.5x - 6x after optimizations) faster than Combine!! And combine can already be around 2x as fast as ReactiveSwift and 1.5x as fast as RxSwift according to benchmarks I found on GitHub. So this should outperform the Reactive framework we're currently using by several factors, while offering an imo nicer interface, which is great!
///
///     However, I also tested against a 'primitive' implementation in swift and objc that replaces observation with manual invokations of the callback block whenever the underlying value changes, and the difference is staggering! The 'primitive' Swift implementation is 134x faster than our kvo wrapper for a simple example and 929x (!!) faster than our kvo wrapper for the 'combineLatest logic. (And combine is another factor 5x - 10x slower)
///
///     The checksums all matched, so they computed the same thing and we built with optimizations.
///
///     ------------------
///     BlockObserver Bench:
///     ------------------
///     Running simple tests with 10000000 iterations...
///     Combine time: 45.459512
///     kvo time: 9.590202
///     primitive objc time: 0.302365
///     primitive swift time: 0.071346
///     swift is **4.23x** faster than objc. objc is **31.71x** faster than kvo. kvo is **4.74x** faster than Combine
///     Running combineLatest tests with 2500000 iterations....
///     Combine time: 54.844566
///     kvo time: 14.305337
///     primitive objc time: 0.059409
///     primitive swift time: 0.015361
///     swift is **3.86x** faster than objc. objc is **240.79x** faster than kvo. kvo is **3.83x** faster than Combine
///     Program ended with exit code: 0
///
///     Caveat:
///         - These bad Combine results were for using the `someObject.publisher(for:)` API inside  which is actually a wrapper for KVO. When using the more swift-native `@Published` macro, Combine is almost as fast as our implementation:
///         -> Based on one test, ours is only  1.14x faster than Combine for the basic observation and 1.08x faster for the combineLatest observation when using `@Published` in Combine.
///

///
/// Technical details:
///     On use of `@synchronized`:
///         We use `@synchronized(observedObject)` throughout this implementation to ensure thread-safety.
///         Afaik `@synchronized(observedObject)`uses a recursiveLock under-the-hood, so there shouldn't be deadlocks even if some other code also tries to synchronize on the `observedObject`.
