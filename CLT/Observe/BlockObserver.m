/// I think we can replace any need for reactive frameworks in our app with a very simple custom API providing a thin wrapper around Apple's Key-Value-Observation.
/// 
/// Comparison with Reactive frameworks:
///     - Key-value-observation should be extremely fast, since it's quite old and mature and at the core of many of Apple's libraries.
///         It should be much faster than ReactiveSwift, and perhaps even faster than Combine. Update: Combine also seems to use KVO under the hood at least when observing properties @objc objects, but it adds a lot of overhead.
///     - Most reactive features like backpressure, errors, hot & cold signals etc, are totally unnecessary for us.
///     - Any 'maps' or 'filters' or similar transforms on 'streams of values over time' we can simply do inside our observation callback block.
///         E.g. filter is just an `if (xyz) return;` statement. compactMap is just `if (newValue == nil) return;`
///     - We can do scheduling by just calling functions like `dispatch_async()` inside the callback block.
///     - As far as I can think of, the only useful thing for MMF  in Reactive frameworks that goes beyond this basic API would be debouncing,
///             but even that we could replace by adding an NSTimer and 3 lines of code inside an observation callback block.
///     - Basically all properties or other values assigned to any NSObject (even NSDictionary) should be observable with KVO - and by extension our BlockObserver API.
///         (KVO works on any setters that use the `setValue:` naming scheming afaik) (Update: with our KVOMutationSupport.m code it even works for mutations on types like NSMutableString!)
///
///     -> Overall this should provide a very performant, simple and modular interface for doing everything we want to do with a Reactive framework.
///

///
/// Benchmarks:
///     Just ran benchmarks on kvo wrapper and this is 3.5x - 5.0x (Update: 4.5x - 6x after optimizations) faster than Combine!! And combine can already be around 2x as fast as ReactiveSwift and 1.5x as fast as RxSwift according to benchmarks I found on GitHub. So this should outperform the Reactive framework we're currently using by several factors, while offering an imo nicer interface, which is great!
///
///     However, I also tested against a 'primitive' implementation in swift and objc that replaces observation with manual invokations of the callback block whenever the underlying value changes, and the difference is staggering! The 'primitive' Swift implementation is 134x faster than our kvo wrapper for a simple example and 929x (!!) faster than our kvo wrapper for the 'combineLatest' logic. (And combine is another factor 5x - 10x slower)
///
///     The checksums all matched, so they computed the same thing and we built with optimizations.
///
///     Here's one of test run outputs:
///     ------------------
///     BlockObserver Bench:
///     ------------------
///     Running simple tests with 10000000 iterations...
///     Combine time: 45.459512
///     kvo time: 9.590202
///     primitive objc time: 0.302365
///     primitive swift time: 0.071346
///     swift is **4.23x** faster than objc. objc is **31.71x** faster than kvo. kvo is **4.74x** faster than Combine
///     Running combineLatest tests with 2500000 iterations....
///     Combine time: 54.844566
///     kvo time: 14.305337
///     primitive objc time: 0.059409
///     primitive swift time: 0.015361
///     swift is **3.86x** faster than objc. objc is **240.79x** faster than kvo. kvo is **3.83x** faster than Combine
///     Program ended with exit code: 0
///
///     Caveat:
///         - These bad Combine results were for using the `someObject.publisher(for:<keyPath>)` API which is actually a wrapper for KVO. When using the more swift-native `@Published` macro, Combine is almost as fast as our implementation:
///         -> Based on one test, ours is only  1.14x faster than Combine for the basic observation and 1.08x faster for the combineLatest observation when using `@Published` in Combine.
///
/// Technical details:
///     On thread safety and use of `@synchronized`:
///         We use `@synchronized(observedObject)`in 3 places and `pthread_mutex` in 1 place inside this implementation to ensure thread-safety. All functions and methods exposed through the interface should be thread safe.
///         Generally, when making things thread-safe I was thinking about:
///             What are the shared mutable resources, and how can we ensure that when they are being mutated, nothing else is accessing or trying to mutate them at the same time. It also helps to think about the big-picture control flow - we don't need to do finegrained locking and unlocking everywhere, if we can just ensure that, when the control flow enters Observe.m, then, before any shared state encapsulated by Observe.m is mutated or read, a lock is always acquired - then we're good! Since the control flow and interface for Obseve.m is relatively simple, that makes things relatively managable. Deadlocks can be avoided by ensuring that you never try to acquire another lock while you already hold a lock. (so you probably shouldn't invoke a callback with foreign code while holding your lock, since it might try to acquire further locks).
///
/// Conclusion: Should we use this?
///     - This adds a light "reactive style" convenience interface on top of kvo.
///     - It's available in objc which I like writing more than swift.
///     - It's usually slightly faster than combine but in the same ballpark.  For performance critical things, you'd still want to use simple function calls since they are much faster, and for UI stuff the performance difference doesn't matter.
///         - Actually, when using Combine as a wrapper for kvo, using `someObject.publisher(for:<keyPath>)`, then Combine is around 3-6x slower than our code in our tests, but for UI Stuff this still probably doesn't matter.
///     - I wrote it and control it so I might understand how to use it better.
///     - I have a general dislike for Swift and all this fancy magic abstraction stuff. But this doesn't really matter, I could get used to either.
///     - The build times for MMF 3 are quite slow. And I suspect that swift is a big factor in that.
///         > I might want to move away from Swift and write more of the UI Stuff in objc. And this might enable that. Some of the main reasons we use so much swift is that we wanted to use reactive patterns for the UI of MMF, which lead us to include the ReactiveSwift framework and build much of the UI code in Swift. MMF 2 which was pure objc iirc, had much faster build times iirc.
///     - BIG CON: This needs to be thread safe. I tried but thread safety is hard. If there are subtle bugs in this, we might make the app less stable vs using an established framework or API.
///         Update: I thought about it again and I'm pretty confident this is thread safe now. There are only a small number of paths through which the control flow can enter the core logic of this file:
///             `addBlockObserver()`, `cancelBlockObservation()`, `[BlockObserver dealloc]`, `observeValueForKeyPath:ofObject:change:context:`, and the callback inside `addBlockObserversForLatestValues()`. If we ensure that all these entry points are thread-safe, which we did, then entire file should be thread safe to use. Maybe I missed something but I think it's not too bad to make this thread safe after all.
///
///     -> Overall this was a cool experiment. It was fun and I learned a bunch of things. Maybe we can adopt this into MMF at some point, but we should probably only adopt it for a new major release where we can thoroughly test this before rolling it out to non-beta users.
///
///     Other takeaways:
///     - Due to the Benchmarks we made for this I saw that, for simple arithmetic and function calling, pure swift seems to be around 4 - 6x faster than our pure C code!! That's incredible and very unexpected.
///         Unfortunately, when you use frameworks or higher level datatypes with Swift, and interoperate with objc, that can sometimes slow things down a lot in unpredictable ways. (See the whole `SWIFT_UNBRIDGED` hassle in MMF., or Combine being 6x slower when used with KVO) Objc/C and its frameworks seem more predictable and consistent to me. But for really low level routines or if you use it right, swift can actually be incredibly fast, which is cool and good to know, and makes me like the language a bit more.
///
/// Update:
///     I just spent a while trying to move MMF to using this, and it's quite a lot of work, definitely a few-days refactor. Also, questionable whether combine would be a better choice than this (Combine API might be a bit shorter / cleaner, and easier to translate from ReactiveSwift, and we'd still be removing a library dependency which should speed up builds. It would be sort of nice to move the UI code away from swift to further improve build times but that would be way too much work! We're stuck with Swift for now.
